How to build a sentence:

| Subject           | Positive                      | Question                                | Negative                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Same subject      | S + would rather + V0         | (QW) + would + S + rather + V0?         | S + would rather + NOT + V0        |
| Different subject | S + would rather + S + V2(ed) | (QW) + would + S + rather + S + V2(ed)? | S + would rather + S + didn't + V0 
*(QW) - optional Question Word*
