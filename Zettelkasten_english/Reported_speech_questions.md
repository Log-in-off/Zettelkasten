The main rules of the questions with reported speech is `step back` in the verb form because  in this case we are actually talking abut past like in [[Reported_speech]] and direct order word like in simple sentences(not revert like in question).
- Do you like cats? -> He asked me if I liked cats  
There are two types of question. 
## General questions
In this case we use **asked**  + **if** or **whether** + direct word order
- She asked if I could meet her.
- They asked whether we were planning to participate in the show. 
- Will you do it? -> She asked whether I would do it.

## Special questions

In this case we just use special question world instead of **if** or **whether**

- He asked when i had been in the office.
- The teacher asked, "When did the era of space travel begin?" -> The teacher asked **when** the era of space travel had began.
- I asked, "How has this film got so popular here?" -> I asked **how** this film had got so popular there. 
- "What are you doing tomorrow morning?" -> Mark asked here **what** she was doing the next morning?
