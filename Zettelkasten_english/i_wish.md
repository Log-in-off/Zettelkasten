This expression is used to tell about our wishes in the present or future
- Present simple:
	- `I don't know how to swim.`
- Wish
	- `I wish I knew how to swim.` (жаль, я не умею плавать)

You should be careful, because this expression has **inverse logic**.
- Present simple
	- `Unfortunately I spend much time for watching youtube video.`
- Wish
	- `I wish I didn't spend much time for watching youtube video.`
	- `I wish I were not so lazy and studied harder.`
	- `She wishes he did a part of chore.` 
``
#### Formula
I wish + [[Past_simple]]

We can use "was" or "were" after `wish/if only` in the 1st and 3rd person singular forms for wishes about present situations. 

| S           | be       |
| ----------- | -------- |
| I/he/she    | was/were |
| it          | was      |
| you/we/they | were     |
it is the same rule as for [[Conditional_sentences]]

If we tell about an **action (to do or not do)** of someones, we should use `would`when we want a situation to change

- Present simple
	- `Your neighbour plays music loudly.`
- Wish
	- `I wish they wouldn't  play music so loudly`
- but
	- `I wish she were(was?) happy.` (todo: ask a expert)
	- `I wish he didn't have to work so long.`
	- `I wish she knew how to dance salsa.`

## We can't use `would`, if we talk about ourselves. 


We can use [if_only] Instead [i_wish] if we want make a wish more emphatic.
- `If only I could speak Spain.`

However this expression doesn't have **inverse logic**.
compare:
 `I wish I knew how to swim.` (жаль, я не умею плавать)
 or
 `If only I knew how to swim.`(если бы только я только умел плавать)
