In [[Reported_speech]] we use `told` and `said` in different ways.

- We use `said` without  any object or `to + an object`.
	- He just **said** that she liked cats. And then he **said to me** that he wanted to buy a collar  as a gift. 
- We have to use an object when we use `told`. We don't put any [[Prepositions]] before it.
	- I also **told him** you were inviting us to a cafe.
